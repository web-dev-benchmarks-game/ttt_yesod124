This is the Yesod implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe benchmark.

It was created using `yesod init`.

# To use

Setting up:

    cabal sandbox init

Running:

    yesod devel

# Not yet implemented

- Check if the game is over and if so, who won.
- Create games against other users.

# FIXMEs

This is my first Yesod application and I'm still very new to Haskell,
so any feedback is welcome!

I feel like postTicTacToeGameR could probably be rewritten to be much
simpler.
